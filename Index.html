            <p>The Asian lion is a species of large cat. These lions are predators, quite similar
                to African lions both in appearance and size. However, they are slightly smaller compared to
                their African relatives. Other notable differences include: tassels on the end of their tails as
                well as bunches of hair on their elbows are longer than these of African lions; unlike their
                African cousins, Asian lions are clearly identified by long folds of skin, stretched along their
                bellies; their manes are shorter than these of African lions, so the ears are seen. Being cats,
                Asian lions possess strong retractable claws and sharp canine teeth. The color of their fur
                varies from buffish-grey with occasional silvery tones, to ruddy-tawny, covered with black
                spots.The Asian lion is a sociable and communicative animal. These lions congregate into small
                social units called prides. The prides can contain only 2 adult females whereas those of African
                lions may include 4-6 adult females. The largest unit of Asian lionesses, ever recorded,
                consisted of just 5 females. However, male lions are not as sociable as females, joining the
                pride mainly for mating and on a large kill.</p>

            The Asian paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone paradisi) is a medium-sized passerine bird native to Asia. Males
            have elongated central tail feathers, and in some populations a black and rufous plumage while others have
            white plumage. Females are short-tailed with rufous wings and a black head. They feed on insects, which they
            capture in the air often below a densely canopied tree.

            With an extremely large range and a large population that appears to be stable, they have been evaluated as
            Least Concern by IUCN since 2004.

            In his first description of 1758, Carl von Linné nominated the species Corvus paradisi. Paradise-flycatchers
            used to be classified with the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae, but are now placed in the family
            Monarchidae together with monarch flycatchers.The Asian or Indian paradise-flycatcher bird is a medium-sized
            bird that belongs to the paradise flycatcher family. These birds belong to the Monarchidae family, which
            consists of passerine birds that can be found all across the world. </p>

        <p>African elephants are the largest animals walking the Earth. Their herds wander through 37
            countries in Africa. They are easily recognized by their trunk that is used for communication and handling
            objects. And their large ears allow them to radiate excess heat. Upper incisor teeth develop into tusks in
            African elephants and grow throughout their lifetime. There are two species of African elephants—the savanna
            (or bush) elephant and the forest elephant. Savanna elephants are larger than forest elephants, and their
            tusks curve outwards. In addition to being smaller, forest elephants are darker and their tusks are
            straighter and point downward. There are also differences in the size and shape of the skull and skeleton
            between the two species.orest elephants are uniquely adapted to the dense forest habitat of the Congo Basin,
            but are in sharp decline due to poaching for the international ivory trade and habitat loss and
            fragmentation. It is estimated that probably one-quarter to one-third of the total African elephant
            population is made up of forest elephants.</p>

        <p>In the age of the National parks, we constantly look for the pristine big cats of India, but
            more often than not, ignore the prime animal of the jungle which is as important as the big cats: Deer.

            One of the most glamorous wild creatures on the planet belongs from the Cervidae Family. Deers come in the
            order of Artiodactyls (even toed ungulates), and ruminant ungulates, i.e. animals who after swallowing their
            food regurgitate the semi-solid digested cud to get the maximum food value.

            Almost every deer species have one distinct characteristic the extended appendages on their head called
            antlers. A gradual process after every shedding it grows once again with a soft, shining, velvety coat
            finally taking the shape which is the most fascinating feature of this taxon. The antlers are made up of
            bones and are well fed by blood vessels which make them prone to breakage. Horns are made of keratin. Horns
            are permanent, while antlers are shed every year.</p>
